      <h1>Mentors</h1>
<p>Only one in four women who graduates with a degree related to science, technology, engineering or math continues to work in that field 10 years after graduation. We need your help to change that. As a woman in a STEM-related career, we invite you to volunteer as a mentor to a UK undergraduate woman majoring or minoring in a STEM discipline. Mentors will regularly interact with one or more students (to be determined by you and your mentee) and attend gatherings with the #IAmAWomanInSTEM student leaders, the leadership teams, and visitors.</p>

<p>The #IAmAWomanInSTEM initiative launched at the University of Kentucky (UK) in the winter of 2015 with funding originally from the American Association of University Women.  The goal of this initiative is to increase graduation rates by women in STEM-related majors/minors at the postsecondary level.  This improvement needs to happen in all our colleges and universities, but we are starting locally and plan to go statewide by 2017. Partnering with the MillionWomenMentors-KY chapter (launched in September 2016 with Lt. Governor Janean Hampton as honorary chair), we seek to scale up the number of mentors available to undergraduate women.</p>

<p>At the core of the initiative is a leadership effort by young college-going women in an awareness campaign by and for undergraduates (via a shared hashtag for social media - #IAmAWomanInSTEM). Crucial to this leadership effortâ€™s success is our mentoring program connecting undergraduate females who are in STEM majors/minors with female faculty/staff members and women in business/industry with STEM backgrounds. The #IAmAWomanInSTEM initiative should build on existing retention and student success initiatives in postsecondary institutions and directly address strategic objectives on diversity, high-impact educational practices, and civic engagement. We seek additional partners to support these efforts, both financially and in volunteer hours.</p>

<h1>Mentor Responsibilities</h1>
<p>#IAmAWomanInSTEM asks for the mentor volunteers to meet with their assigned student ambassadors at times that are determined to be best for each other (aiming for a total of 20 hours contact time per calendar year). In addition, we include the mentors in a private Googlegroup where general announcements are made by the leadership team (perhaps one or two messages per month). We also encourage the mentors to participate in our social media accounts (see icons in bottom left nav bar). Student ambassadors have used their personal social media accounts, and in-person presentations, to launch their own campaigns to support women in STEM. Ideally, these projects are supported and guided by their mentors. See more ideas about #IAmAWomanInSTEM mentoring in the suggestions handout (.pdf file) attached below. See also, Donna J. Dean's Getting the most out of your mentoring relationship - A handbook for women in STEM (Springer, 2009).</p>

  <p>Are You an Undergraduate Student Majoring in a STEM Field?
Volunteer as a STUDENT LEADER - someone who will serve as a student ambassador for the #IAmAWomanInSTEM initiative. We need students to take on their own individual projects, participate in group initiatives, or become STEM Group leaders to organize sessions for other #IAmAWomanInSTEM leaders to get together.
Are You a Woman Who is Currently Working in a STEM+H Career as an Entrepreneur, Engineer, Technician or Scientist, Faculty, Staff or Administrator? We are looking for mentors who would be willing to spend up to 20 hours a year with one or more of our #IAmAWomanInSTEM student ambassadors. Sign up here to volunteer to serve as a MENTOR for an #IAmAWomanInSTEM student leader.</p> -->
