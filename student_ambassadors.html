    <div class="row info">
<p style="margin-top: 50px;">In Spring 2017, Ndeye Thiaw and Mollye Malone launched the #IAmAWomanInSTEM Student Organization at UK. Find out more about the role of the student organization and the opportunities for leadership on the IAAWIS Student Org at UK webpage.

Also, Heather Campbell (Mechanical Engineering major) and Kayla Kuhfeldt (Biology major) launched "STEM Groups" to gather together for networking and studying. See more information on this initiative on the STEM Groups webpage. We encourage all first- and second-year #IAmAWomanInSTEM student ambassadors join a STEM Group - please sign up here (webform).

Spring 2017 also offered academic credit to #IAmAWomanInSTEM student ambassadors. Three sections of EXP396 were offered to students who were taking leadership roles in the initiative. This experiential education course is very flexible and allows for student ambassador to work with their mentors in collaboration with a faculty expert in the task undertaken.
<p style= "padding-bottom: 25px;">We welcome all faculty to serve as instructors for an experiential education course for #IAmAWomanInSTEM student ambassadors - and encourage our students to send a message to iamawomaninstem@gmail.com to find out more about setting up an experiential education course and earn academic credit for their work on this initiative.

In Spring 2016, 28 #IAmAWomanInSTEM student ambassadors enrolled in a leadership and service-learning course (UK300, 2 credit hours - download the Spr2016 syllabus here). They had opportunities to engage with University and community members in solving authentic community-identified problems and successes associated with gender in STEM-related careers, and to reflect on these experiences with peers and the course co-facilitators.

      <p1>In Spring 2017, Heather Campbell (Mechanical Engineering major) and Kayla Kuhfedt (Biology major) launched "STEM Groups." These groups of undergraduate women with similar interests (same majors at UK and/or career choices) gather together for networking and studying. We encourage all first- and second-year #IAmAWomanInSTEM student ambassadors join a STEM Group - please sign up under the group you would like to join.</p1>
